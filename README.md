# books_crawler
A Python script which crawls 'megasrbija' website, looks for recently addded PDF books, IT PDF books, audiobooks or magazines,
and if found, I receive a push notification on my phone, with title, author, published date/time and link to download page.

I've used BeautifulSoup4 for scraping the website and PushBullet API for sending a notification to my phone.
